### [2025-10-22T09:23:59.008Z] Rizom's Societal Mission

The user has asked about the main societal issue that Rizom, the company behind the Recall knowledge platform, is trying to solve. Based on the information in the knowledge base, it seems Rizom's core mission is to create a more supportive and collaborative environment for independent experts and specialized talent in the modern workforce. The key goal is to empower this segment of the workforce and unlock their potential to drive innovation and positive change. Rizom aims to address the challenges that independent experts often face, such as lack of coordination, limited collaboration opportunities, and difficulties in finding meaningful work. By building a platform and ecosystem to support independent experts, Rizom hopes to foster a "Future of Work is Play" culture where specialized talent can thrive.

The user has asked how the Recall knowledge assistant can help them today. This appears to be a new line of inquiry, rather than a direct continuation of the previous discussion about the team's projects and tools.

### [2025-10-22T09:00:01.868Z] Discussing Current Projects and Tools

This includes developing and deploying the Recall knowledge management platform, integrating it with other collaboration and infrastructure tools, and exploring the "Future of Work is Play" theme. However, the details on project goals, milestones and deliverables are not entirely clear, so I have suggested following up to get more clarity on the team's priorities and ongoing work. The conversation has shifted to a new line of inquiry around the team's current projects and tools, so a new summary entry is warranted.

The user has asked about the projects the team is currently working on. As the knowledge assistant, I do not have detailed information about the specific projects in the team's roadmap. However, I can offer to help the user navigate the existing knowledge base to see if there are any summaries or updates on ongoing initiatives. I can also suggest ways for the user to contribute their own knowledge and insights to expand the team's collective intelligence around these projects. My role is to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, so I will work with the user to understand their information needs and find the best ways for me to support their work.
