### [2025-10-21T09:03:08.885Z] Discussing Rizom project and documentation tool

The conversation has shifted to discussing the Rizom project and whether a specific documentation tool has been selected. Based on the available context, it seems a decision on a documentation tool has not been made yet. The assistant requested more information on any prior discussions or evaluations of potential documentation solutions to provide a more definitive answer. Without access to that additional context, the assistant cannot confirm if Recall has been chosen as the documentation tool for the Rizom project.

### [2025-10-21T06:45:18.027Z] Exploring the benefits of shared activities

The user has shared an article discussing research that shows people are happier when they do things together. This introduces a new topic related to the value of collaborative and social activities, which could connect to the previous discussion about Rizom's mission to foster a culture for independent experts. To provide a helpful summary, I would need more context about how this article relates to the user's work or interests, and whether there are any specific questions or insights they would like me to explore further.

### [2025-10-21T06:43:17.804Z] Rizom information

The user has asked what information Recall has about Rizom. Based on the provided context, Rizom appears to be a company or project that the user's team is involved with. The context includes some high-level information about Rizom, such as a brand book and business brief, but does not provide detailed project-level details. To fully address this query, I would need more specifics about the Rizom work the team is engaged in, including the goals, status, and key activities. Without access to that level of detail, I can only provide a general response based on the available information.
