# The Death of the Corporate Job

## URL
https://thestillwandering.substack.com/p/the-death-of-the-corporate-job

## Description
An analysis of the decline of traditional corporate jobs and the rise of remote and freelance work.

## Summary
The article discusses how the corporate job model is becoming less common, with more people opting for remote, freelance, and entrepreneurial work arrangements. It explores the factors driving this shift, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the desire for more flexibility and work-life balance, and the decline of job security and loyalty in large organizations. The author argues that the traditional 9-to-5 office job is becoming obsolete, and that the future of work will involve more distributed, decentralized, and independent forms of employment.
