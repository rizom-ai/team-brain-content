## Description
This article discusses a study that found people are happier when they do activities together rather than alone.

## Summary
A new study has found that people are happier when they do activities with others rather than alone. The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, analyzed data from over 400,000 people and found that shared experiences, even mundane ones like commuting or eating, led to greater feelings of well-being and life satisfaction. The researchers suggest that being with others, even in passing, triggers social rewards in the brain that boost mood and happiness. The findings highlight the importance of social connection and shared experiences for overall mental health and happiness.
