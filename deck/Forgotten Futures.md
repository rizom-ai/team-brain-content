# Forgotten Futures

## Intelligence as Practice

---

## Core Question

> Are we building systems that **practice** intelligence  
> or systems that **simulate** it?

---

## Intelligence = Agency

Active resistance to **entropy**  
through **purposeful practice**

---

## AI Winters as Selection Events

### First Winter (1974-1980)

- ❌ Bottom-up learning
- ✓ Rule-based control

### Second Winter (1987-1993)

- ❌ Human reasoning
- ✓ Statistical scaling

**Each winter selected against emergence, for control**

## The Road Not Taken

### Conway's Game of Life

**3 Simple Rules → Universal Computation**

## Artists Understood

- **[Casey Reas](http://reas.com/)** - Code practices art
- **[Ian Cheng](http://iancheng.com/)** - Autonomous narratives
- **[Pierre Huyghe](https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/pierre-huyghe)** - Living ecosystems
- **[Hito Steyerl](https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/hito-steyerl)** - Critical AI practice
- **[Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/)** - Data sculptures

## The Doom Economy

> Raise billions to protect us from  
> **the systems you're building**

Existential risk = funding engine

---

## Two Futures

### Intelligence as **Service**

- Passive consumption
- Atrophying agency
- Centralized control

### VS

### Intelligence as **Practice**

- Active collaboration
- Shared agency
- Distributed emergence

---

## Building the Rhizome

# RIZOM

### The Future of Work is **Play**

**∞** Decentralized ecosystems, not hierarchical control  
**⟳** Knowledge flows freely while preserving ownership  
**◈** Collective intelligence from individual autonomy  
**⚡** Human-machine meet in shared practices

> We're not waiting for the winter—  
> we're **building the alternative now**

---

## Living Infrastructure

### 🧠 Knowledge Brains

Personal → Team → Collective  
Git-based knowledge that evolves

### 🔐 Algorithmic Trust

Outcome-based certification  
Trust without gatekeepers

### 🌐 Open Protocols

HTTP, MCP, ACP standards  
No platform lock-in

### 💎 Ownership Stakes

Franchise model with equity  
Own what you build

**Capture → Remix → Share → Scale**

Intelligence that **practices with you**

---

## The Question Ahead

> Not "How do we build AGI?"  
> but  
> "What practices do we enable?"

The next AI winter isn't a crisis to avoid—  
it's an opportunity to remember what intelligence actually is:

**the practice of creating meaning**
