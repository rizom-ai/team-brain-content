# Fatality!

**Solid grounds for collaboration**

---

## Who are we?

---

We are Rizom. A global collective of independent
professionals connected by the belief that the **Future of
Work is Play.**

---

## Why do we need Rizom?

---

Succesful collaboration comes from a culture of **shared trust**. While there may be a lot of ways to create such a culture in traditional companies, individual professionals constantly need to reinvent the wheel

---

## How does Rizom solve this problem?

---

By creating **an ecosystem of people, tools, contracts, and formats** to uplift independent professionals

---

## How does Fatality! fit in?

---

Fatality! is our **amuse-bouche**. A small single-bite dish to prepare your palate for the courses to come. It is designed by us to showcase what Rizom offers. 

---

## We hope you'll enjoy it!
