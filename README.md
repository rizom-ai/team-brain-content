## Your First 5 Minutes ‚è±Ô∏è

**Goal:** Verify Team Brain is working

### Steps

- [ ] Open your Matrix room
- [ ] Send this message: `Hello Scout!`
- [ ] Wait for Scout's greeting response (typically 2-5 seconds)
- [ ] See Scout introduce itself and confirm it's ready

**‚úì You just verified Team Brain is working!**

**Next up:** Ask real questions ‚Üí

---

## Lesson 1: Asking Questions ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

**Goal:** Get answers from your team's knowledge base

### How It Works

Scout can answer questions using everything your team has captured. Just ask naturally, like you would a teammate.

### Steps

- [ ] Ask a simple question: `What projects is the team working on?`
- [ ] Wait for Scout's response (5-10 seconds while it searches)
- [ ] Try another question: `What did we decide about authentication?`
- [ ] Ask a third question about something relevant to your team

**üí° Tip:** Scout searches your team's knowledge base - links, conversations, and documents. The more content you have, the better the answers.

### üëã Hands-on Exercise

Ask Scout **3 different questions** about your team:

1. [ ] A question about a current project
2. [ ] A question about a past decision
3. [ ] A question about team processes or tools

### Troubleshooting

**Scout not responding?**

- Check `/help` to see available commands
- Verify you're in the correct Matrix room
- Contact your admin if issues persist

## Lesson 2: Capturing Links ‚è±Ô∏è 15 minutes

**Goal:** Add web content to your team's knowledge base

### How It Works

When you share a URL in chat, Scout automatically:

- Extracts the content from the webpage
- Generates a summary
- Identifies relevant topics
- Saves everything to your knowledge base

This takes 10-20 seconds. You'll see a confirmation when it's complete.

### Steps

- [ ] Share a URL in chat: Paste `https://example.com/article`
- [ ] Wait for Scout's confirmation (10-20 seconds)
- [ ] Visit the website at https://babal.io
- [ ] Find your captured link on the homepage
- [ ] Click into it to see the AI-generated summary

**üí° Tip:** You can paste URLs directly - no commands needed. Scout watches for links and processes them automatically.

### üëã Hands-on Exercise

Capture **3 different links** and verify each on the website:

1. [ ] Share a technical article URL
2. [ ] Share a documentation page URL
3. [ ] Share a blog post or news article URL
4. [ ] Visit https://babal.io and find all 3 links

### Troubleshooting

**Link not captured?**

- Check that the URL is valid and accessible
- Note: Some sites block automated access (paywalls, login-required pages)
- Try a different URL if one fails
- Check the website after 30 seconds - processing might take a moment

## Lesson 3: Topics and Summaries ‚è±Ô∏è 10 minutes

**Goal:** Understand automatic knowledge organization

### How It Works

Scout doesn't just store information - it organizes it automatically:

- **Topics:** Extracted from links and conversations (10-20 seconds after sharing)
- **Summaries:** Created automatically from conversation windows

You don't need to tag or categorize anything manually. Scout does this by analyzing the content.

### Steps

- [ ] Have a natural conversation in chat about a project or decision:
  ```
  We decided to use Hetzner for deployment.
  The EU data residency was the key factor.
  Also, their pricing is better than AWS for our use case.
  ```
- [ ] Use `/topics-list` command to see automatically extracted topics
- [ ] Notice topics like "deployment", "Hetzner", etc.
- [ ] Use `/summary-list` to see conversation summaries Scout has created
- [ ] Visit https://babal.io to see topics on the homepage
- [ ] Click into a topic to see all related content organized together

**üí° Tip:** Scout extracts topics from both links and substantial conversations. The more context you provide, the better the organization.

### üëã Hands-on Exercise

1. [ ] Have a brief conversation about a project (3-4 messages)
2. [ ] Check `/topics-list` to see extracted topics
3. [ ] Check `/summary-list` to see summaries
4. [ ] Browse topics on the website
5. [ ] Find content from Lesson 2 organized under topics

### Troubleshooting

**No topics yet?**

- Topics are extracted from links and substantial conversations
- Try sharing more links or having a longer discussion
- Processing can take up to 30 seconds

**Empty summary?**

- Summaries are created automatically after several messages
- Normal if you're the first one chatting today
- Keep having conversations - summaries will appear
