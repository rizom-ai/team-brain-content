# About

This is a professional brain - a personal knowledge management system and portfolio.

## What is This?

A brain is a knowledge management application built on the Brains framework. It combines:

- **Knowledge Base**: Store and organize notes, links, and ideas
- **AI Assistant**: Natural language interface for querying and creating content
- **Static Site**: Publish your work as a professional website

## How It Works

Content is stored as markdown files that sync bidirectionally with a local database. This gives you:

- **Full ownership**: Your data lives in plain text markdown files
- **Version control**: Track changes with git
- **Flexibility**: Export, backup, or migrate anytime
- **AI enhancement**: Semantic search and AI-powered features

## Technology

Built with:

- **Brains Framework**: Open-source knowledge management platform
- **Preact**: Lightweight UI components
- **Anthropic Claude**: AI assistance
- **Markdown**: Simple, portable content format

## Get Started

Edit the files in `seed-content/` to customize your brain:

- `identity/identity.md`: Configure your AI assistant's personality
- `profile/profile.md`: Your professional profile
- `site-info/site-info.md`: Website configuration
- `HOME.md` and `README.md`: Homepage and About page content

Add more markdown files to build your knowledge base. Everything syncs automatically.
